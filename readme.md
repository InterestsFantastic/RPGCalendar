Simple RPG calendar, with 7 day week, 4 weeks per month,
3 months per season, 4 seasons per year.

The calendar starts at year zero by default. The lunar phase calculation
reflects that. Year 0, 4, 8, ... are waxing moons.
There are 7*4*3*4 = 336 days per year in this Calendar, ~92% of a year.

Seasons line up with the numbers of the months and as such it's more readable.

The lunar phases are by default weekly, though for my own game I created the
option of having a lunar phase that operated yearly instead.
