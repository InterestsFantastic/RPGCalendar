'''Simple RPG calendar, with 7 day week, 4 weeks per month, 3 months per season, 4 seasons per year.

The calendar starts at year zero by default. The lunar phase calculation reflects that. Year 0, 4, 8, ... are waxing moons. There are 743*4 = 336 days per year in this Calendar, ~92% of a year.

Seasons line up with the numbers of the months and as such it's more readable. The calendar starts on year zero, which may not be preferred by some. That said, I am tracking double lunar phases here (1/4 of a cycle, rather than 1/8).

The lunar phases are by default weekly, though for my own game I created the option of having a lunar phase that operated yearly instead.

There are a bunch of reporting options, including those easily machine- readable and reports that are more immersive. Some are below.

Day 2, Week 4, Month 1, Year 1. Lunar Phase: Full.

It is the 23rd of Springswax, of the year 1. It is Spring and the moon is full.

It is the 2nd day of the 4th week of the 1st month of Spring. The moon is full.

2,4,1,1,1,2

The choice of "back" for "backwards" is for brevity.'''
